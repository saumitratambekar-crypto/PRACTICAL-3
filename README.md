This SQL script builds a complete college database system step by step. First, it ensures that any existing database named college_demo is dropped, then creates a fresh database with that name and switches to it using USE college_demo. The script defines four tables:
department: stores department IDs and names, with dept_id as the primary key.
student: stores student details such as roll number, name, email, Aadhaar number, and department ID. The dept_id here is a foreign key linking each student to their department.
course: stores course details with course_id as the primary key and links each course to a department via dept_id.
enrollment: records which student is enrolled in which course, along with the semester and grade. It uses a composite primary key (roll_no, course_id, semester) and foreign keys referencing both the student and course tables.
After defining the structure, the script inserts sample data: three departments (Computer Science, Mechanical, Electronics), three students with unique roll numbers and Aadhaar numbers, and three courses linked to departments. Finally, it records enrollments showing which student took which course, in which semester, and their grade.
The SELECT * queries after each insertion display the contents of the tables, allowing you to verify that the data has been correctly inserted. In summary, this code sets up a mini relational database for a college, with proper relationships between departments, students, courses, and enrollments, and demonstrates how to populate and query it.
